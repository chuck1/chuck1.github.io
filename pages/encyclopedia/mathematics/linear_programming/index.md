# linear programming

Linear programming is a method for optimization in a mathematical model whose requirements are linear relationships.

In canonical form:

Maximize or minimize $$\mathbf{c}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{x}$$ subject to $$\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} \le \mathbf{b}$$ and $$\mathbf{x} \ge \mathbf{0}$$

where $$\mathbf{x}$$ is a vector of variables, $$\mathbf{b}$$ and $$\mathbf{c}$$ are known vectors, and $$\mathbf{A}$$ is a known matrix.
