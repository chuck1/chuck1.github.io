# set theory

## notation

$$ x \in A $$

$$x$$ is an element of set $$A$$

$$ A \subset B $$

$$A$$ is a subset of $$B$$. All elements in $$A$$ are also in $$B$$. There are elements in $$B$$ that are not in $$A$$.

$$ A \subseteq B $$

$$A$$ is a subset of $$B$$. All elements in $$A$$ are also in $$B$$. There could be elements in $$B$$ that are not in $$A$$ or they could be equal.

$$ A \cup B $$

Union of $$A$$ and $$B$$.

$$ A \cap B $$

Intersection of $$A$$ and $$B$$.

$$ A \backslash B $$

set difference of $$A$$ and $$B$$. $$\{x : x \in A , x \notin B\}$$.
