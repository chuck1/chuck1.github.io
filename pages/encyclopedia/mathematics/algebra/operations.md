# operations

Addition and multiplication have similar structure.
In defining this structure we will use $$\bigcirc$$ to represent the operator.

associativity

$$
a \bigcirc (b \bigcirc c) = (a \bigcirc b) \bigcirc c
$$

commutivity

$$
a \bigcirc b = b \bigcirc a
$$

identity. for both operations, there exists a value $$I$$, called the identity, such that

$$
x \bigcirc I = x
$$

inverse. for both operations, there exists a function, denoted $$\mathrm{inv}(x)$$, such that if

$$
a \bigcirc b = c
$$

then

$$
a = c \bigcirc \mathrm{inv}(b)
$$
