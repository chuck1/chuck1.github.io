# vertex identification

Vertex identification is the process of taking two adjacent vertices and combining them into one.
We can describe different situations encountered when identifying vertices.
These situations are composed of two independent conditions: whether the vertices
are connected by one or more than one edge and whether or not they have common neighbors.

## situations
