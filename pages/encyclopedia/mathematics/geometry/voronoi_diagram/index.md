# Voronoi Diagram

Take a set of points in space, called voronoi points.
Divide space into regions, one region for each point.
Determine to which region any point in space belongs to by finding the voronoi point that minimizes a distance function.

## Algorithm

We will define the voronoi diagram as a connected set of vertices and edges and higher order features constructed from those vertices and edges.

## Observations
