## tangent to circle through a point

There is a circle centered at point A with radius $$a$$ and a point B outside the circle.
Let $$b$$ be the distance from A to B.

Let C be the midpoint of segment AB.
Draw a circle centered at C with radius $$b/2$$.

The tangent points are the intersections of the two circles.

## outer tangent of two circles

There are two circles centered at points A and B with radii a and b.
They are separated by distance d.
Assume that $$b$$ is greater than $$a$$.

Draw a circle of radius $$b-a$$ centered at point B.
Draw a tangent from point A to the new circle and let C be the tangent point.
Draw a line from B to C.
Let point D be the intersection of BC and the circle at B with radius $$b$$.

Draw a line parallel to AC going through point D.

## inner tangent of two circles

There are two circles centered at points A and B with radii $$a$$ and $$b$$.
Draw a circle of radius $$a+b$$ centered at point A.
Find the tangent point C between the new circle and point B.
Let D be the intersection of AC and the circle at A with radius $$a$$.

Draw a line parallel to BC going through point D.
