			<h2 id="tangent-to-circle-through-a-point">tangent to circle through a point</h2>

<p>There is a circle centered at point A with radius <script type="math/tex">a</script> and a point B outside the circle.
Let <script type="math/tex">b</script> be the distance from A to B.</p>

<p>Let C be the midpoint of segment AB.
Draw a circle centered at C with radius <script type="math/tex">b/2</script>.</p>

<p>The tangent points are the intersections of the two circles.</p>

<h2 id="outer-tangent-of-two-circles">outer tangent of two circles</h2>

<p>There are two circles centered at points A and B with radii a and b.
They are separated by distance d.
Assume that <script type="math/tex">b</script> is greater than <script type="math/tex">a</script>.</p>

<p>Draw a circle of radius <script type="math/tex">b-a</script> centered at point B.
Draw a tangent from point A to the new circle and let C be the tangent point.
Draw a line from B to C.
Let point D be the intersection of BC and the circle at B with radius <script type="math/tex">b</script>.</p>

<p>Draw a line parallel to AC going through point D.</p>

<h2 id="inner-tangent-of-two-circles">inner tangent of two circles</h2>

<p>There are two circles centered at points A and B with radii <script type="math/tex">a</script> and <script type="math/tex">b</script>.
Draw a circle of radius <script type="math/tex">a+b</script> centered at point A.
Find the tangent point C between the new circle and point B.
Let D be the intersection of AC and the circle at A with radius <script type="math/tex">a</script>.</p>

<p>Draw a line parallel to BC going through point D.</p>
