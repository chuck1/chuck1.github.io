# Rail System Limit

Trains will be used to move materials between different factories.
A possibly limitation is the rate at which items can be moved by the rail system.

## Producing multiple products at a factory

Instead of having separate sites for every single item and having to transport intermediate
products between sites, certain groups of items should be produced together.
This can drastically reduce the amount of items being transported by the rail system.

For example, almost all iron ore will be used to produce iron plate.
If we produce all of our iron plate at the iron ore mines, we almost completely eliminate
the need to transport iron ore through our rail system.

To decide when to do this, consider what a particular intermediate product is consumed by.
If say more than 50% of it is used to make a certain other product, then maybe that product should be produced
in the same place.
Of course, it depends on what other ingredients are involved.

## Separate Lines

One way to increase throughput is to create separate lines for different routes and use a base layout
that minimizes the need for crossings.
This way, trains will have a straight shot with no obstructions between source and destination and it is easy 
to add multiple parallel rails to increase the capacity of such a line.
