After watching Cody from the YouTube channel Cody's Lab [make supercritical CO2 in a glass tube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z-KbcLs-yo), I was excited to replicate his experiment.
I am fascinated by supercritical fluids and I thought it was cool that this experiment would be very inexpensive.

This experiment required five things

 * dry ice
 * small diameter borosilicate glass tube
 * propane torch
 * a method for weighing dry ice with about 0.02 gram accuracy
 * a chamber that could contain exploding glass tubes and had a window for filming
