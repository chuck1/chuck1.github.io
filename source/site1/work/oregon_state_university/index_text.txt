Title of research - Numerical Design of a High-Flux Microchannel Solar Receiver 
Worked with faculty and other students to design microchannel receivers for solar thermal power production 
Performed numerical simulations of heat transfer and fluid flow using commercial software: Ansys Fluent and StarCCM+ 
Assessed pressure drop, thermal efficiency, structural integrity and flow distribution 
Published two conference papers for the ASME conference on Energy Sustainability
