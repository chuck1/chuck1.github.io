<p>For my <a href="/projects/physics/supercritical_fluid">supercritical fluid project</a>, I needed to measure dry ice with a precision of at least 0.02 grams.
I decided to built a microgram balance using inexpensive materials, based on designs I had seen online.
My goal was to measure out a predetermined amount of dry ice.</p>
<p>On one end is a cup.
On the opposite end are counterweights of unknown mass with variable positions.
I used two counterweights whose masses were at least an order of magnitude different for course and fine control.
The level arm for the cup was significantly longer than that of the counterweight.</p>
<p>I hypothesize that the scale will appear to be balanced when the net torque is below some threshhold.
The torque induced by a mass in the cup is</p>
<p>T = m g r</p>
<p>m = T / g / r</p>
<p>If T is the torque threshhold, then m is the error in mass.
In other words, if a mass of m is added to the cup of a perfectly balanced scale, the scale will not move.
Therefore, larger r gives smaller error.</p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clean and dry the cup</li>
<li>To the cup, add the desired mass of water. The water must be measured using other means. I used a 1 mL syringe.</li>
<li>Move the counterweights until the scale balances. It is important that the counterweights are secured so they do not move.</li>
<li>Remove the water and clean and dry the cup. It is important that the cup is not deformed and does not change position during this step.</li>
<li>Add material to the cup until the scale balances.</li>
</ul>
