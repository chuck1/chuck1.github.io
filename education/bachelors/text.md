# mechanical design project

Automatic sorter of (cylindrical) recyclable materials (steel cans, aluminum cans, glass bottles, plastic bottles)

- vertical hopper with paintbrush at opening to control flow of material
- shaker driven by electric motor to move material out of hopper
- spring loaded ramp to separate heavier glass items
- magnet-covered drum spun by electric motor to grab and separate steel cans


# Senior Project

Test aparatus for planar laser-induced fllourecense (PLIF) thermometry

- a rectangular transparent tank holds a solution of a flourecent dye
- a laser beam is expanded into a sheet using a cylindrical lense
- the laser sheet (oriented vertical) enters the tank through one of the walls
- a camera looks through another wall, perpendicular to the laser sheet
- the laser causes the dye to flourese; the camera captures an image (2D map of flourescence intensity).
- a two-dye solution was used
- a special camera lense with two apertures (used to take 3D photos) creates two identical images side-by-side
- each aperture has a different filter so that each captures mostly the light emitted by one of the dyes
- the tank is heated by resistive heater sheets connected to a variac
- an electric stirrer is submerged in the tank to stir the solution and get uniform temperature
- temperature of the solution is measured with four thermocouples connected to a DAQ and read by a LabView program
- the goal is to calibrate the ratio of flourescence intensity between the two dyes to the temperature of the liquid. if successful, this setup can be used to non-intrusively gather high-resolution 2D temperature maps in a liquid
